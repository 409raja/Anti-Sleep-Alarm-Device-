# Anti-Sleep-Alarm-Device-
This project tackles the rise in road accidents caused by driver drowsiness. The proposed Anti Sleep Alarm for Drivers activates when it detects the driver falling asleep, sounding an alarm for at least 10 seconds to wake the driver. This simple, cost-effective system aims to reduce accidents due to driver fatigue.
